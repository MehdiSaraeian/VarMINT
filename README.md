# VarMINT
The **Var**iational **M**ultiscale **I**ncompressible **N**avier--Stokes **T**oolkit:  A small Python module with re-usable functionality for solving the Navier--Stokes equations in FEniCS, using a variational multiscale (VMS) formulation.  This project is still being developed and tested.
